## About
The Makabayan bloc is a group of progressive party-list organizations in the Philippines. It is composed of several political parties that advocate for social justice, human rights, and national sovereignty. The member organizations within the Makabayan bloc include Bayan Muna, Gabriela Women's Party, ACT Teachers Party, Kabataan Party-list, and Anakpawis (Gavilan, 2022). The Makabayan bloc and its member organizations have been subjected to red-tagging by certain individuals, groups, or institutions, particularly those with differing political ideologies (CNN Philippines, 2020). These accusations of red-tagging have been a source of contention and have raised concerns about the safety and security of members within the Makabayan bloc. Thus, this project aims to provide insights regarding the redtagging of the Makabayan bloc.
